# Patient-Similarity-Scoring
Patients often exhibit highly complex clinical presentations in the clinic, making it difficult to determine optimal treatment solutions or understand health risks in any particular patient. Meanwhile, electronic health record systems and health records provide rich information on aspects of patients such as diagnosis and medication histories. These data can be leveraged in order to identify patients that are similar to each other via patient similarity algorithms. The insight from patient similarity may be used for applications such as allocation of resources, determining targeted treatment plans, or constructing cohorts for predictive modeling studies. There are several strategies for patient similarity, including graph based algorithms. This project implements a simple similarity algorithm in Spark GraphX using Scala.
